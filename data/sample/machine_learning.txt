Machine Learning: A Comprehensive Guide

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Learning Paradigms

1. Supervised Learning
   - Learning from labeled training data
   - Examples: Classification, regression
   - Algorithms: Linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines
   - Applications: Spam detection, medical diagnosis, price prediction

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
   - Examples: Clustering, dimensionality reduction
   - Algorithms: K-means, hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis
   - Applications: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, data compression

3. Reinforcement Learning
   - Learning through interaction with environment
   - Examples: Game playing, robotics, autonomous systems
   - Algorithms: Q-learning, policy gradients, deep Q-networks
   - Applications: Game AI, autonomous vehicles, recommendation systems

4. Semi-supervised Learning
   - Combines labeled and unlabeled data
   - Useful when labeled data is expensive or scarce
   - Algorithms: Self-training, co-training, label propagation

5. Transfer Learning
   - Applying knowledge from one domain to another
   - Reduces training time and improves performance
   - Common in computer vision and natural language processing
