# Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

This document defines the Service Level Objectives for the Production RAG Service.

## Overview

Our SLOs are designed to ensure high-quality, reliable, and cost-effective RAG service delivery. These objectives are monitored continuously and used to drive operational improvements.

### Cost Efficiency

| Metric | Target | Current | Measurement |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Cost per Request | ≤$0.015 | $0.012 | Cost tracking |
| Token Efficiency | ≤200 tokens/req | 180 tokens/req | LLM metrics |
| Cache Efficiency | ≥60% reduction | 75% reduction | Redis metrics |

## Error Budgets

### Monthly Error Budgets (30 days)

- **Quality Budget**: 36 hours (5% of month)
- **Performance Budget**: 14.4 hours (2% of month)
- **Availability Budget**: 43.2 minutes (0.1% of month)

### Error Budget Consumption

| Budget Type | Consumed | Remaining | Status |
|-------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Quality | 8 hours | 28 hours | Green |
| Performance | 3 hours | 11.4 hours | Green |
| Availability | 5 minutes | 38.2 minutes | Green |

## Alerting Thresholds
